    info: `Push-pull is a style of training that structures workouts based on your muscles movement patterns. 

       With this training style, you train upper body muscles that perform pushing  movements one day and upper body muscles that perform pulling movements another day — either on the following day or separated by a rest day, depending on your experience level.

      Here are the muscles that perform pushing and pulling movements: 

       Pushing: chest, shoulders, and triceps. 

       Pulling: back, biceps, and forearms`,

    info: `A full body workout is just what it sounds like: a workout that aims to hit all the major muscle groups in one single session. Popular programs would include exercises for back, legs, chest, shoulders, arms and core.

    There are many reasons some trainees like to utilise a full body workout, whether from time to time or as a standard go-to in their workout routine.
    
    When performing full-body workouts, you don’t want to waste time doing isolation exercises, You want to get the biggest, hardest exercises done for the biggest muscle stimulation.`

    fullName: "High intensity training",
    forWho: "Advanced",
    info: `The fundamental principles of high-intensity training (HIT) are that exercise must be very intense, but workouts should be relatively brief and infrequent.
\
     Exercises are performed with a high level of effort, or intensity, where it is thought that it will stimulate the body to produce an increase in muscular strength and size.

    As strength increases, HIT techniques will have the weight/resistance increased progressively where it is thought that it will provide the muscles with adequate overload to stimulate further improvements. 
    There is an inverse relationship between how intensely and how long one can exercise.
     As a result, high-intensity workouts are generally kept brief. After a high-intensity workout, as with any workout, the body requires time to recover and produce the responses stimulated during the workout, so there is more emphasis on rest and recovery in the HIT philosophy than in most other weight training methods.

    info: `A workout split is how you divide up your workouts throughout the week either by body region, movement, specific body part, or by lift. This divide-and-conquer approach to exercise allows bodybuilders and general gym-goers to focus their efforts in a way that optimizes results.

    Instead of hoping for bigger muscles or more strength, you guarantee it by sticking to a plan proven to work. Workout splits allow you to work smarter and harder. 
    
    In this piece, we’ll give you all the information you need to devise your own workout split and some advice on how to stick to it.`,
