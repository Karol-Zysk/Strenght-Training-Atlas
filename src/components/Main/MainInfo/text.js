    Skeletal muscles are the only muscles that can be consciously controlled.
    They are attached to bones, and contracting the muscles causes movement of
    those bones.<br></br>
    <br></br> Any action that a person consciously undertakes involves the use
    of skeletal muscles. Examples of such activities include running, chewing,
    and writing.
