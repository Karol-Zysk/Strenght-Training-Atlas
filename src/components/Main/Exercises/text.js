    Skeletal muscles are the only muscles that can be consciously controlled.
    They are attached to bones, and contracting the muscles causes movement of
    those bones.<br></br>
    <br></br> Any action that a person consciously undertakes involves the use
    of skeletal muscles.

  "Lie on your back on a flat bench. Grip a barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Slowly lift bar off rack, if using, and lower the bar to the chest, allowing elbows to bend out to the side.Stop lowering when elbows are just below the bench. Press feet into the floor as you push the bar back up to return to starting position.",

  "Take the bar out of the rack . Take two big steps back and stand with your feet roughly shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly out.`` Keep your spine in alignment by looking at a spot on the floor , then “sit” back and down as if you are aiming for a chair. Descend until your hip crease is below your knee. Keep your weight on your heels as you drive back up.",

  "Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand with your arms hanging by your sides. Ensure your elbows are close to your torso and your palms facing forward. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale as you curl the weights up to shoulder level while contracting your biceps.",

  "Get into military press position, holding a barbell to the side of your head in one hand. You'll need to have your hand in the middle of it to stop it toppling, and you'll have to go super-light. Press it, making sure you don't tilt your body to either side, then lower under control.",

  "Your elbows should be close to your rib cage. Pause at the bottom. To begin the upward movement, squeeze your triceps and begin to push the dumbbells back to the starting position. Continue to press until your arms are long with a slight bend in your elbows.",

  "Sit on a leg extension machine. Position your legs under the pad and grasp the side bars with your hands. This is the starting position. Extend your legs to the maximum, exhaling as you do so. Pause a second in this contracted position. Lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale. Make sure your legs don't go past the 90-degree angle point.",
